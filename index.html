            <blockquote>
                <p>I am a Software Engineer with a passion for technology and have enjoyed all aspects of it from a young age. I started developing and the first application that stands out in my memory was an application I wrote in junior high in QBasic that drew the Mandelbrot set. From there I have kept working on or around development and have always had a driving interest in creating and inventing.</p>
