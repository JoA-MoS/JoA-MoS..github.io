Recently I have had a number of individuals ask me "Why are you not building your site from scratch?" I do have an answer to this but first lets talk about what I want to accomplish and what the options are to establish my thinking and how I made my decision.

**Goals:**

* Be my web presence
* Always up
* Free or near free to host
* Use my custom domain
* Easy to update / Deploy
* Easy to post
* Easy to customize
* A portal to get to my other projects
* A place to host my resume

**Options:**

* Custom Site
* Wordpress
* Drupal
* Other Blogging Engines
* Jekyll

### The thought process

I have had some experience in hosting my website and a blog in the past. I have used blogengine.net a .NET based blogging engine, I have written a complete custom site, I dabbled with Wordpress and also Drupal. All have their pros and cons I am going to talk about those specifically as they relate to my goals.

I think it would be easiest to summarize it in a table (also demonstrate some of the why jekyll in the process, up until now this entire blog entry has been written in markdown I'm going to start mixing in HTML)

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
